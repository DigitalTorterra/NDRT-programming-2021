# NDRT Programming Challenges

This repository contains the challenges (and eventually solutions) for
the NDRT programming 101 "course". Look in the rest of this repository
for the solutions for a given week.

## Week 1: Python Basics

This week, we went over the basics of how to use Python, including:

* basic arithmetic
* simple data types
* variables
* `if`/`elif`/`else` statements
* `while` loops

The challenges were as follows:

1. Write a program to solve a quadratic equation.
2. Write a program to find the sum of the first `n` numbers, where
   `n` is a variable you can set
3. Write a guessing game, where you have to guess a number between
   `1` and `100`.
   
## Week 2: Intro to Git and GitHub

This week, we covered the process of getting set up with git and GitHub.
No programming challenge for this week!
